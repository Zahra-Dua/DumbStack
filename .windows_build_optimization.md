# Windows Build Memory Optimization Guide

If you're experiencing "Out of memory" errors during Flutter builds on Windows, try these solutions:

## 1. Close Unnecessary Applications
- Close browser tabs, IDEs, and other memory-intensive applications
- Free up at least 8GB of RAM before building

## 2. Increase Windows Virtual Memory (Page File)
1. Right-click "This PC" → Properties
2. Advanced System Settings → Performance Settings
3. Advanced tab → Virtual Memory → Change
4. Set custom size: Initial = 4096 MB, Maximum = 8192 MB
5. Restart computer

## 3. Build in Profile Mode (Uses Less Memory)
```bash
flutter run --profile -d <device-id>
```

## 4. Build APK Directly (Bypasses Some Memory Issues)
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

## 5. Use 64-bit JDK
Ensure you're using 64-bit Java Development Kit (JDK)

## 6. Disable Antivirus Temporarily
Some antivirus software can interfere with build processes

## Current Gradle Settings (Optimized):
- Max Heap: 2GB (reduced from 8GB)
- Max Metaspace: 1GB (reduced from 4GB)
- Parallel builds: Disabled (reduces memory usage)
- G1 Garbage Collector: Enabled (better memory management)
